# SepiaFilterAsm

A program that enables the user to apply the sepia filter to an .bmp image.
The goal of this university project is to compare the speed/efficiency of "hand-written" x86 Assembly code to a compiler-optimized higher level language (here it's C++).

Both algorithms produce the same exact image, but the speed varies.
The user may choose the number of threads for the algorithm to be executed parallel on and also the strength of the filter (sepia coefficient).

The user can choose the algorithm/method of applying the filter:
- an algorithm written in x86 Assembly Language,
- an algorithm written in C++, optimized by the compiler.
